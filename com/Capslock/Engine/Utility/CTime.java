 * This class acts as a framerate timer.
 * It is packaged along with the screen and input classes in the engine instance object at runtime.
 * 
 *  This class also provides some functionality for keeping track of the time spent in game, such as keeping track of the time spent during pausing, so as not to falsely alter the framerate.
