/*
 * This class acts as a framerate timer.
 * It is packaged along with the screen and input classes in the engine instance object at runtime.
 * 
 *  This class also provides some functionality for keeping track of the time spent in game, such as keeping track of the time spent during pausing, so as not to falsely alter the framerate.
 *  
 *  There are two main framerates kept track of in the CTime class.
 *  
 *  The first, which is not exactly "tracked" is the desired framerate. The desired framerate is the framerate the engine should aim to achieve.
 *  This framerate will never exceed 1000fps, due to limitations within java whereby we track the time taken per frame in milliseconds.
 *  This framerate will also never equal 0. if it does, it will be set to the default framerate as determined by DEFAULT_FRAMERATE.
 *  
 *  The second framerate which is actually tracked is the "actual framerate". This framerate is the framerate actually achieved by the engine. it is calculated based on how long the last frame took to execute.
 *  
 *  The CTime class provides the functionality to pause and resume the framerate timer so as not to influence the percieved framerate when we are not in the game loop.
