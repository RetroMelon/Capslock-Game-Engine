 * The Physical class is the class which implements all of the properties of a physical object in the real world.
 * It allows the object to have the following:
 * 
 * 		Velocity
 * 		Acceleration
 * 		Mass
 * 		Friction
 * 		Forces (applied instantaneously to the object)
 * 
 * The velocity is the number of pixels that the entity will move every second.
 * We determine how far to move based on the current framerate of the game.
 * The current framerate is acquired from the Engine Instance class which must be passed to this class on creation.
 * 
 * The acceleration is the change in velocity that occurs every second. The change in velocity is also determined by the 
 * framerate which is acquired using the engine instance class.

	 * The friction is the factor by which the velocity will slow down every second.
	 * The friction factor is essentially an indication of how much of the 
	 * friction will always act on an object, regardless of whether it is accelerating, at a constant speed, or at rest.
	 * 
	 * Details on the friction factor are contained within method 1.
	 * 
	 * WE WILL BE USING METHOD 1 AS OUR IMPLEMENTATION.
	 * 
	 * there are two ways to apply the friction. the first is to calculate approximately how much of the velocity to remove given the current framerate like this:
	 * 
	 * 1.		
	 * 			The "friction rating" will be split in to 100 parts, although it can be set higher if it needs to be. kind of like a percentage of how much friction acts on the object. 
	 * 			a friction rating of 100 will mean that the object will stop within 1 second.
	 * 			a friction rating of 0 will mean that friction does not act o the object.
	 * 			if the user desires for the object to stop in under 1 second, then the friction rating should be increased above 100.
	 * 			a friction rating of 1000 should stop the object in 0.1 of a second and so on. 
	 * 
	 * 			the friction rating will be described as a vector, because the friction rating can be different along the x and y axes.
	 * 			
	 * 			this formula will be applied along each axis independently. here is what the formula will look like along the x axis.
	 * 
	 * 				
	 * 
	 * 			Here we take aq portion of the velocity away from itself. the portion will increase as the frictionratio increases. 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 2. 
	 * 		I have left this method in the comments in case for any reason we wish to use it. however, i have not researched it fully enough and as a result i cannot be positive thatit is a valid method.
	 * 
	 * 		velocity = velocity * nth root of ratio (where n equals the framerate)

	 * 
	 * The mass will never equal 0, so as for the event not to arise in which we would be dividing by 0. as a result, if the user of this class attempts to set the mass to 0,

	 *
